RAG Index

For RAG stuff I'm thinking Wikipedia articles + the references (especially to pubmed articles to influence scoring of the pubmed articles), medline plus (in a similar way -- increase ranking of referenced pubmed articles), us preventive resources task force

Standards of Care? Looks like we have to license these (ugh) buuuut maaaaybe could get them on the cheap given *current news*.


For billing rate denails: https://www.apcdcouncil.org/state/map (although maybe not ES maybe PSQL?)
